# Problem statement
# You have been given an array ‘a’ of ‘n’ unique non-negative integers.



# Find the second largest and second smallest element from the array.



# Return the two elements (second largest and second smallest) as another array of size 2.



# Example :
# Input: ‘n’ = 5, ‘a’ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Output: [4, 2]

# The second largest element after 5 is 4, and the second smallest element after 1 is 2.
